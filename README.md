## SaveGame Manager for Steamdeck

A tool that i've made to mantain my pc Savegames synced with my steamdeck ones.
 
- It supports bi-directional sync
- It require Rclone to be installed (you can get it from scoop in windows or any package manager in linux)
- If you need to skip some files in some game define them into "filter-list.txt"


**Working on a Decky plugin to replace the Linux UI.
